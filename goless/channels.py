       blocking until a receiver for the value is available.
    3. Otherwise just append the value to the deque returning immediately.

    When receiving:

    1. If the buffer has items, pop and return the first value.
       Before returning, if there is a sender waiting,
       receive its value and append it to the buffer.
    2. Else just receive on the channel,

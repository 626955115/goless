"""``goless`` introduces go-like channels and select to Python,
built on top of Stackless Python (and maybe one day gevent).
Use :func:`goless.chan` to create a synchronous or buffered channel.
Use :func:`goless.select` like you would the ``Select`` function in Go's reflect package
(since Python lacks a switch/case statement, replicating Go's select statement syntax
wasn't very effective).
